  # Sidekiq has a web dashboard which you can enable below. It's turned off by
  # default because you very likely wouldn't want this to be available to
  # everyone in production.
  #
  # Uncomment the 2 lines below to enable the dashboard WITHOUT authentication,
  # but be careful because even anonymous web visitors will be able to see it!
  # require "sidekiq/web"
  # mount Sidekiq::Web => "/sidekiq"
  #
  # If you add Devise to this project and happen to have an admin? attribute
  # on your user you can uncomment the 4 lines below to only allow access to
  # the dashboard if you're an admin. Feel free to adjust things as needed.
  # require "sidekiq/web"
  # authenticate :user, lambda { |u| u.admin? } do
  #   mount Sidekiq::Web => "/sidekiq"
  # end
